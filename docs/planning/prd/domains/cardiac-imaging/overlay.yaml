description: >
  Domain overlay for cardiac structure segmentation. Targets the
  Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) cardiac dataset. Key challenges:
  motion artifacts, thin myocardial walls, multi-structure segmentation.

dataset:
  name: "MSD Cardiac"
  modality: "Cardiac MRI (cine, late gadolinium enhancement)"
  structures:
    - name: "Left ventricle"
      label_id: 1
      difficulty: "Medium"
    - name: "Right ventricle"
      label_id: 2
      difficulty: "Medium"
    - name: "Myocardium"
      label_id: 3
      difficulty: "High — thin walls"
  challenges:
    - "Cardiac motion artifacts"
    - "Thin myocardial walls"
    - "Multi-class segmentation"
    - "Varying image quality across scanners"

metric_adjustments:
  adjustments:
    - metric: hausdorff_95
      weight_boost: 0.10
      rationale: "Surface accuracy critical for thin myocardial walls"
    - metric: surface_dice
      weight_boost: 0.05
      rationale: "Surface overlap important for boundary delineation"

loss_adjustments:
  adjustments:
    - loss: boundary_loss
      viability_boost: 0.10
      rationale: "Helps with thin myocardial wall segmentation"
    - loss: deep_supervision
      viability_boost: 0.05
      rationale: "Multi-scale supervision for complex cardiac structures"

prd_prior_adjustments:
  adjustments:
    - decision_id: loss_functions
      option_id: focal
      adjustment: "+0.05"
      rationale: "Focal loss helps with class imbalance in multi-structure"
