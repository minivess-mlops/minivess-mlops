description: >
  Domain-agnostic overlay for any 3D medical image segmentation task.
  Uses backbone defaults without domain-specific adjustments. Suitable
  for quick experimentation with new datasets from the Medical
  Segmentation Decathlon or similar challenges.

  modality: "Any (CT, MRI, PET)"
  structures:
    - name: "Target structures"
      label_id: "varies"

  challenges:
    - "Unknown domain-specific characteristics"
    - "Variable image quality"
    - "Unknown class distribution"

notes: >
  This overlay serves as the default when no domain-specific information
  is available. When starting a new dataset, begin here and create a
  domain-specific overlay as you learn the data characteristics.
