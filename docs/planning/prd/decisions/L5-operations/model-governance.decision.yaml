description: >
  How model lifecycle is tracked, approved, and governed. Full registry
  provides structured promotion stages and approval workflows; MLflow
  tags offer lightweight governance via experiment metadata; none means
  ad-hoc model management. Compliance-critical for SaMD-principled design.

    description: >
      Structured model registry with staging, production, and archived
      lifecycle stages. Approval workflows, automated evaluation gates,
      and audit trail. PCCP-ready governance: predetermined change boundaries
      for ML model updates per FDA PCCP final guidance (Dec 2024). Tracks
      model version, training data version, performance metrics, and change
      impact classification. Supports EU AI Act Article 12 automatic
      record-keeping. Requires MLflow Model Registry or dedicated governance
      platform.

rationale: >
  MLflow tags (0.40) is the resolved choice (Zaharia et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2020),
  providing lightweight governance via experiment metadata and SaMD-principled
  audit trails aligned with IEC 62304 lifecycle (IEC, 2015). Model Cards
  (Mitchell et al., 2019) provide structured documentation. AI governance
  frameworks (Schneider et al., 2024) inform the full registry upgrade path
  when compliance depth increases.
