description: >
  How model lifecycle is tracked, approved, and governed. Full registry
  provides structured promotion stages and approval workflows; MLflow
  tags offer lightweight governance via experiment metadata; none means
  ad-hoc model management. Compliance-critical for SaMD-principled design.

      Structured model registry with staging, production, and archived
      lifecycle stages. Approval workflows, automated evaluation gates,
      and audit trail. Requires MLflow Model Registry or dedicated

rationale: >
  MLflow tags (0.40) is the resolved choice, providing lightweight
  governance via experiment metadata and SaMD-principled audit trails.
  Full registry (0.30) is the upgrade path when compliance depth
  increases or team scaling demands structured approval workflows.
