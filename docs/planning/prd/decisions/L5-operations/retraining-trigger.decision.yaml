  What conditions trigger model retraining. Drift-based triggers retrain
  when data or model drift is detected; scheduled triggers retrain on a
  fixed cadence; data-volume triggers retrain when new data exceeds a
  threshold; manual triggers retrain on human request. Affects model
  freshness, compute costs, and operational complexity.

    description: >
      Trigger retraining when data or model drift exceeds defined
      thresholds. Requires robust drift detection (Evidently, whylogs)
      and automated pipeline orchestration. Most responsive but
      needs careful threshold tuning.

      unnecessarily or miss urgent drift.

    description: >
      Trigger retraining when new annotated data exceeds a threshold

rationale: >
  Drift-based (0.30) and manual (0.25) are both reasonable starting points.
  Manual is currently implemented as the project is in development. Drift-based
  is the next step when the monitoring stack and drift detection mature, with
  PPRM (Zhang et al., 2026) providing formal false alarm guarantees for
  automated triggers. Subasri et al. (2023) demonstrate clinical drift
  patterns motivating drift-based retraining. Data volume triggers (0.20)
  are natural for medical imaging batch workflows.
