description: >
  How model cards, data sheets, and technical documentation are generated.
  Automated cards generate from MLflow metadata and code; manual requires
  hand-written documentation; CI-generated integrates with CI/CD pipelines;
  none means no structured documentation. Compliance-relevant for
  SaMD-principled audit trails.

      Model cards and data sheets auto-generated from MLflow metadata,

      with model card generation from experiment runs. Ensures
      documentation stays synchronized with actual model state.

rationale: >
  Automated cards (0.35) is the resolved choice, generating model cards
  from MLflow metadata following the Model Cards framework (Mitchell et al.,
  2019). Manual (0.30) is partially implemented for ADRs. CI-generated
  (0.20) is the next step when CI/CD doc pipelines mature, supported by
  evidence from Rosmarino et al. (2025) on MLOps-driven regulatory
  documentation and Lähteenmäki et al. (2023) on the RegOps lifecycle.
