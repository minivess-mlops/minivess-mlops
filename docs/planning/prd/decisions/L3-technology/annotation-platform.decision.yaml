rationale: >
  Label Studio (0.35) and MONAI Label (0.35) are equally weighted as both
  serve complementary roles. Label Studio provides workflow management and
  multi-annotator support; MONAI Label provides AI-assisted 3D annotation.
  Label Studio is in docker-compose config. The choice depends heavily on
  MONAI alignment — MONAI-native projects should prefer MONAI Label.
