title: "Experiment Tracking"
description: >
  Which experiment tracking platform to use for logging metrics, parameters,
  artifacts, and model versions. The choice affects reproducibility depth,
  team collaboration patterns, and integration with the broader MLOps stack.
  Must support 3D medical imaging artifacts (NIfTI volumes, surface meshes,
  calibration plots).

      Open-source experiment tracking with model registry. Self-hosted,
      no vendor lock-in. Supports custom artifacts, auto-logging, and
      DuckDB analytics overlay. Already the primary tracking platform.

    title: "Weights & Biases"
    description: >
      Cloud-native experiment tracking with rich visualization. Superior

rationale: >
  MLflow (0.45) is resolved as the primary platform (Zaharia et al., 2018). It is
  self-hosted, open-source, and already integrated with DVC, Hydra-zen configs,
  and DuckDB analytics. MLOps surveys (Kreuzberger et al., 2023; Ruf et al., 2021)
  confirm MLflow's position as the leading open-source experiment tracker. W&B (0.25)
  is the strongest alternative with superior visualization but introduces cloud
  dependency. Neptune (0.15) and ClearML (0.15) are viable alternatives with smaller
  communities in medical imaging.
