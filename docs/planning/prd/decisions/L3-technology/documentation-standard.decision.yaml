  What level of documentation to maintain for models, experiments, and
  the system. Full model cards follow the Mitchell et al. framework with
  complete fairness and limitations sections; lite model cards capture
  essential metadata; regulatory dossiers meet IEC 62304; README-only
  uses minimal documentation.

rationale: >
  Lite model cards (0.35) are resolved/implemented via model_card.to_markdown()
  auto-generation during training. Full model cards (0.30) are the natural
  upgrade for publication-ready documentation. The documentation standard is
  strongly coupled to compliance depth — lightweight audit pairs with lite
  cards, full IEC 62304 requires regulatory dossiers.
