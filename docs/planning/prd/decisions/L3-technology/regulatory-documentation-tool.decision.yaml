title: "Regulatory Documentation Tool"
description: >
  Which tool or approach to use for generating and managing regulatory
  documentation (IEC 62304 artifacts, ISO 13485 design history files,
  ISO 14971 risk management files). Ranges from manual templates to
  UL-certified automated platforms. Ketryx (2% of 2024 FDA AI/ML approvals)
  provides automated compliance evidence generation. Innolitics RDM offers
  open-source markdown+YAML approach proven in 510(k) submissions.
  OpenRegulatory provides free IEC 62304/ISO 13485/ISO 14971 templates.
  Choice strongly depends on compliance depth and project management tool.

      Full-featured with built-in workflows, electronic signatures,

      Better suited for established medical device companies than
      research teams.

rationale: >
  Ketryx (0.30) leads due to UL certification, proven FDA track record (2% of
  2024 AI/ML approvals), 90% documentation reduction, and free tier for
  pre-market teams. Innolitics RDM (0.25) and OpenRegulatory (0.25) provide
  zero-cost alternatives aligned with the "everything as code" philosophy
  (Stirbu et al., 2021). Traditional QMS platforms (0.20) are viable for
  established teams but overkill for research phase. The choice is strongly
  coupled to compliance depth — lightweight_audit pairs with free templates,
  full IEC 62304 needs Ketryx or traditional QMS.

research_notes: >
  Phase 11 research. Ketryx free tier is key enabler for small teams —
  pre-market companies with <$2M funding get 3 projects and 4 users free.
  Innolitics RDM has been used in actual 510(k) submissions (verified via
  GitHub repository and company website). OpenRegulatory templates are
  well-maintained and used by startups in EU/US.
