description: >
  How to assess and improve the quality of segmentation labels. Cleanlab
  detects label errors using confident learning; custom inter-annotator
  agreement (IAA) measures consistency between annotators; CrowdKit
  aggregates multiple annotations; none accepts labels as-is.

      Confident learning for detecting label errors in segmentation masks.
      Identifies likely mislabeled samples using model predictions and
      data-centric AI. Present in dependencies but not integrated into
      the annotation or training pipeline.

    title: "CrowdKit"
    description: >
      Toloka CrowdKit for annotation aggregation. Implements Dawid-Skene,

rationale: >
  Cleanlab (0.40) is the preferred tool for automated label quality assessment
  using confident learning. It's in dependencies but not integrated since
  annotation workflows are not yet active. Custom IAA (0.30) complements
  Cleanlab for multi-annotator scenarios. The decision is coupled to annotation
  platform choice — Label Studio integration enables Cleanlab's confidence
  learning loop.
