  How to evaluate the quality and faithfulness of explainability outputs.
  Quantus provides standardized meta-evaluation metrics for XAI methods;
  custom metrics allow domain-specific evaluation; none defers meta-evaluation
  until XAI itself is integrated.

      Standardized meta-evaluation library for XAI. Provides faithfulness,
      robustness, complexity, localisation, and randomisation metrics.
      Present in dependencies but not integrated since XAI (Captum) itself
      is not yet wired to the pipeline.

      Current state since neither XAI nor meta-evaluation is integrated.
      Acceptable for initial exploration but insufficient for publication.

rationale: >
  Quantus (0.40) is the preferred meta-evaluation framework given its
  comprehensive metric library and standardized evaluation protocol.
  However, this decision is blocked by the XAI strategy resolution —
  Captum for 3D volumetric data needs to be integrated first before
  meta-evaluation is meaningful. Current state is effectively "none"
  since neither XAI nor meta-evaluation is active.
