title: "Agent Framework"
description: >
  Which agent orchestration framework to use for LLM-driven pipeline
  automation. Agents manage multi-step workflows: hyperparameter
  suggestions, experiment triage, report generation, and adaptive
  retraining triggers. The framework determines how agent state,
  tool calling, and human-in-the-loop patterns are implemented.

    title: "LangGraph"
    description: >
      Graph-based agent orchestration from LangChain. Supports stateful
      multi-step workflows, human-in-the-loop, and persistence.
      Partially implemented with initial agent definitions. Referenced
      as primary agent orchestrator in CLAUDE.md.

  - option_id: crewai
    title: "CrewAI"
    description: >
      Multi-agent framework with role-based agent definitions. Simpler
      than LangGraph for predefined workflows. Good for team-of-agents
      patterns but less flexible for custom graph topologies.
    prior_probability: 0.20

    constraints:
      - "Less flexible than LangGraph for custom workflows"

    description: >
      Microsoft's multi-agent framework. Strong for conversational
      multi-agent patterns and code generation tasks. Active development
      with AutoGen Studio.
    prior_probability: 0.15
    status: viable

    constraints:
      - "Heavier dependency footprint"
      - "Microsoft ecosystem alignment may not fit MONAI stack"

  - option_id: custom
    title: "Custom Agent Framework"
    description: >
      Build lightweight agents directly on LLM provider APIs with custom
      state management. Maximum control, minimum dependency, but
      significant development effort for tool calling and persistence.
    prior_probability: 0.25

    implementation_status: not_started
    constraints:
      - "Tool calling, state management, and persistence from scratch"

rationale: >
  LangGraph (0.40) is resolved-partial as the primary agent framework, with
  initial agent definitions for experiment triage and report generation.
  Custom (0.25) has notable prior because lightweight domain-specific agents
  may not need a full framework. CrewAI (0.20) is a simpler alternative for
  predefined multi-agent workflows. AutoGen (0.15) is viable but less
  aligned with the existing MONAI/LangChain stack. Domain applicability is
  lower than core ML decisions because agents are supplementary automation.
