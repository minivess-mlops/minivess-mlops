title: "MONAI Alignment"
description: >
  How tightly to align with the MONAI ecosystem. MONAI-native uses only
  MONAI components; MONAI-compatible uses MONAI alongside other tools;
  framework-agnostic avoids MONAI lock-in.

    title: "MONAI Native"
    description: >
      Use MONAI for everything: transforms, models, metrics, training loops,
      Bundle format, MONAI Deploy, MONAI FL. Maximum ecosystem integration
      but limits flexibility.

    title: "MONAI Compatible"
    description: >
      Use MONAI for core ML (transforms, models) but integrate other
      tools freely (TorchIO, TorchMetrics, BentoML). Current implementation.

      Avoid MONAI dependency. Use pure PyTorch with custom code.
      Maximum flexibility but loses MONAI ecosystem benefits.

  MONAI transforms and model zoo while freely integrating TorchIO,
  TorchMetrics, BentoML, and other non-MONAI tools.
