title: "Open Source Model"
description: >
  Licensing strategy for the project. Affects which dependencies can be used
  and how the project can be shared. Already resolved as MIT.

options:
  - option_id: permissive_mit
    title: "Permissive (MIT)"
    description: >
      MIT license. Maximum reuse flexibility. Compatible with all
      downstream uses including commercial.
    prior_probability: 0.50
    status: resolved
    implementation_status: production

  - option_id: copyleft_gpl
    title: "Copyleft (GPL)"
    description: >
      GPL license. Ensures derivatives remain open. May limit
      clinical/commercial adoption.
    prior_probability: 0.10
    status: rejected

  - option_id: restricted_nc
    title: "Restricted (Non-Commercial)"
    description: >
      CC-BY-NC or similar. Allows academic use, restricts commercial.
      Common in medical imaging research.
    prior_probability: 0.15
    status: rejected

  - option_id: proprietary
    title: "Proprietary"
    description: >
      Closed source. Maximum control but limits community contribution
      and academic impact.

rationale: >
  MIT is resolved (0.50 prior). The project already uses MIT license.
  Proprietary has 0.25 prior reflecting that clinical deployment paths
  often require it.
