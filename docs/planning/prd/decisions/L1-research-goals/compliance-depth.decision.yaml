title: "Compliance Depth"
description: >
  How deeply to implement regulatory compliance (IEC 62304, FDA guidance,
  EU AI Act, ISO 14971). Lightweight audit is current implementation. Full
  compliance requires significant infrastructure investment. Phase 11 research
  synthesizes: IEC 62304 Edition 2 (expected Sep 2026) will expand to all
  health software with AI/ML provisions; FDA PCCP (Dec 2024) enables iterative
  ML updates within pre-approved boundaries; 10 GMLP Principles (Oct 2021)
  define good ML practice; EU AI Act (Aug 2027 for medical devices) adds
  Articles 9-15 requirements; ISO 14971:2019 Clause 10 triples post-production
  coverage; AAMI TIR 34971:2023 addresses ML-specific risks. Rosmarino et al.
  (2025) demonstrate MLOps-driven regulatory documentation automation.
  Martina et al. (2024) validate DevOps-based IEC 62304 maintenance.
  Granlund et al. (2022) advocate "calm compliance." Stirbu et al. (2021)
  propose "everything as code" for RegOps pipelines.

rationale: >
  Lightweight audit (0.40) is the sweet spot for a learning/portfolio project.
  It demonstrates regulatory awareness without the overhead of full compliance.
  The SaMD-principled approach is already implemented (model cards, audit trails).
  Recent evidence supports automated compliance approaches: Rosmarino et al. (2025)
  demonstrate MLOps-driven regulatory documentation generation for IEC 62304,
  Martina et al. (2024) validate DevOps-based IEC 62304 maintenance via CI/CD,
  and Lähteenmäki et al. (2023) introduce the RegOps lifecycle for continuous
  regulatory compliance. The EU AI Act (Niemiec, 2025) adds urgency for
  classification-aware compliance. The new regops_automated option (0.15)
  represents an emerging middle path between lightweight audit and full IEC 62304.

research_notes: >
  Phase 11 research significantly expanded regulatory landscape understanding.
  Key findings: (1) IEC 62304 Ed.2 (Sep 2026) will expand scope to all health
  software and add AI/ML-specific requirements; (2) FDA PCCP (Dec 2024) enables
  iterative ML model updates within pre-approved boundaries; (3) EU AI Act
  (Aug 2027 for medical devices) adds Articles 9-15 requirements including
  human oversight and cybersecurity; (4) ISO 14971:2019 triples post-production
  coverage; (5) AAMI TIR 34971:2023 provides ML-specific risk checklists;
  (6) "Calm compliance" and "everything as code" are emerging paradigms for
  reducing compliance overhead. New PRD nodes added: project_management_tool,
  regulatory_documentation_tool, clinical_deployment_platform.
  Internal: ADR-0005 (docs/adr/0005-tdd-mandatory.md) documents the TDD mandate
  that underpins the compliance approach.
