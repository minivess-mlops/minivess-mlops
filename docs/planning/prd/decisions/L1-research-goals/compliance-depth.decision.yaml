title: "Compliance Depth"
description: >
  How deeply to implement regulatory compliance (IEC 62304, FDA guidance).
  Lightweight audit is current implementation. Full compliance requires
  significant infrastructure investment. Rosmarino et al. (2025) demonstrate
  MLOps-driven automation of regulatory documentation for AI-based SaMD.
  Martina et al. (2024) validate DevOps-based approaches to IEC 62304
  software medical device maintenance via CI/CD. Niemiec (2025) provides
  EU AI Act compliance implications for medical AI classification.
  Lähteenmäki et al. (2023) introduce the RegOps lifecycle concept for
  continuous AI/ML regulatory compliance.

rationale: >
  Lightweight audit (0.40) is the sweet spot for a learning/portfolio project.
  It demonstrates regulatory awareness without the overhead of full compliance.
  The SaMD-principled approach is already implemented (model cards, audit trails).
  Recent evidence supports automated compliance approaches: Rosmarino et al. (2025)
  demonstrate MLOps-driven regulatory documentation generation for IEC 62304,
  Martina et al. (2024) validate DevOps-based IEC 62304 maintenance via CI/CD,
  and Lähteenmäki et al. (2023) introduce the RegOps lifecycle for continuous
  regulatory compliance. The EU AI Act (Niemiec, 2025) adds urgency for
  classification-aware compliance. The new regops_automated option (0.15)
  represents an emerging middle path between lightweight audit and full IEC 62304.
