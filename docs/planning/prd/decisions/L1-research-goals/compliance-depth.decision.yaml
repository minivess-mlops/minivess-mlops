description: >
  How deeply to implement regulatory compliance (IEC 62304, FDA guidance).
  Lightweight audit is current implementation. Full compliance requires
  significant infrastructure investment.

    title: "IEC 62304 Full Compliance"
    description: >
      Complete Software as Medical Device lifecycle. Requires formal
      risk analysis, design history file, verification & validation
      protocols, change control. Significant overhead.

      - "Regulatory expertise required"
      - "Formal V&V protocols"
      - "Change control process"

    title: "Lightweight Audit Trail"
    description: >
      SaMD-principled design without full compliance. Model cards,
      audit trails, reproducibility. Demonstrates awareness without
      regulatory overhead. Current implementation.

rationale: >
  Lightweight audit (0.50) is the sweet spot for a learning/portfolio project.
  It demonstrates regulatory awareness without the overhead of full compliance.
  The SaMD-principled approach is already implemented (model cards, audit trails).
