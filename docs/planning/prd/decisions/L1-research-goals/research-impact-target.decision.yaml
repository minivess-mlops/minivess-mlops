title: "Research Impact Target"
description: >
  What form of research output does this project target? Conference papers
  need reproducible experiments; journal papers need thorough methodology;
  benchmark contributions need standardized evaluation; course material
  needs pedagogical clarity.

rationale: >
  Conference papers have highest prior (0.35) as the most common first output
  for ML research. Standardized evaluation (Maier-Hein et al., 2024) and
  explainability surveys (Patricio et al., 2024) represent key publication
  targets. Course material at 0.20 reflects that claude-code-patterns.md
  already partially serves this role.
