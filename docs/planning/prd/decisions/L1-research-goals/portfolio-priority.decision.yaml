title: "Portfolio Priority"
description: >
  Trade-off between breadth (many tools, shallow integration) and depth
  (fewer tools, production-grade integration). Already resolved as
  breadth-first with 30+ tools integrated.

    description: >
      Maximize tool exposure. Integrate many tools even if some are
      config-only or placeholder. Demonstrates awareness of ecosystem.
      Current active choice: 30+ tools across 38 modules.

  - option_id: depth_over_breadth
    title: "Depth Over Breadth"
    description: >
      Focus on fewer tools with production-grade integration. Each tool
      fully tested, documented, and battle-tested. Better for clinical path.

  - option_id: balanced
    title: "Balanced"
    description: >
      Mix of breadth and depth. Core tools (MLflow, MONAI, BentoML) get
      deep integration; supporting tools get config-only integration.

rationale: >
  Breadth-first is resolved at 0.55. With 30+ tools across 38 modules,
  the project has demonstrated breadth. Future work may shift toward
  depth for specific tools.
