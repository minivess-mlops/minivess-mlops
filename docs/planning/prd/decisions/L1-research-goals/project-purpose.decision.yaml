title: "Project Purpose"
description: >
  Foundational decision: why does this project exist? Drives all downstream
  architecture and technology choices. Self-learning maximizes tool exposure;
  portfolio demonstrates production competence; clinical deployment targets
  real-world use; open-source contribution builds community.

options:
  - option_id: self_learning
    title: "Self-Learning"
    description: >
      Primary goal is maximizing personal learning and tool exposure.
      No fear of overengineering — every tool is a learning opportunity.
      Accept that some integrations may be superficial.
    prior_probability: 0.45
    status: resolved
    implementation_status: implemented
    constraints:
      - "Single developer capacity"
      - "Time investment must have learning ROI"

  - option_id: portfolio
    title: "Portfolio Demonstration"
    description: >
      Build a showcase of production-grade patterns for biomedical ML.
      Each integration must be well-documented and demonstrable.
      Quality of documentation matters as much as code.
    prior_probability: 0.30
    status: resolved
    implementation_status: implemented
    constraints:
      - "Must be publicly shareable"
      - "Code quality must be demo-ready"

  - option_id: clinical_deployment
    title: "Clinical Deployment"
    description: >
      Target real-world hospital deployment. Requires IEC 62304 compliance,
      federated learning, regulatory documentation. Significant infrastructure
      and compliance overhead.
    prior_probability: 0.15
    status: viable
    implementation_status: not_started
    constraints:
      - "Requires clinical partnerships"
      - "IEC 62304 full compliance"
      - "Multi-site validation"

  - option_id: open_source_contribution
    title: "Open Source Contribution"
    description: >
      Build reusable components for the MONAI ecosystem. Focus on
      generalizable tools, MONAI Bundles, community engagement.
    prior_probability: 0.10
    status: viable
    implementation_status: not_started
    constraints:
      - "Must follow MONAI contribution guidelines"
      - "Community engagement overhead"

rationale: >
  Prior probabilities reflect the current project state: self-learning is
  the dominant driver (0.45) with portfolio as strong secondary (0.30).
  Clinical deployment and open-source are future possibilities that keep
  the architecture flexible.
