title: "Reproducibility Standard"
description: >
  How strictly to enforce reproducibility. Full deterministic requires
  fixed seeds, exact dependency pinning, and hardware-specific configs.
  DVC-versioned tracks data and experiments. Git-only relies on code
  versioning alone.

rationale: >
  DVC-versioned (0.50) is resolved. The project uses DVC for data versioning
  and MLflow for experiment tracking, providing good reproducibility without
  the performance overhead of full deterministic mode.
