  name: "MinIVess MLOps v2 Probabilistic PRD Decision Network"
  version: "2.1.0"
  last_updated: 2026-02-24
  description: >
    Bayesian decision network with 70 nodes across 5 hierarchical levels.
    Adapted from the music-attribution-scaffold format for biomedical
    image segmentation MLOps. Captures open-ended decisions for a
    learning-first, portfolio-building, MONAI-compatible system.

    v2.1.0: Verification gap analysis — RDF (636 entries), BIB (934 entries),
            DataLad investigation, end-to-end systems fishing expedition.
            20 new bibliography entries. Added DataLad option to
            data_management_strategy (prior 0.10, experimental). Added 1 new
            edge (compliance_depth → data_management_strategy). Updated 8
            decision nodes with new references: data_management_strategy (+7),
            drift_detection_method (+6), drift_response (+5),
            regulatory_compliance_approach (+4), monitoring_stack (+3),
            model_governance (+2), reproducibility_standard (+2),
            uncertainty_quantification (+1). Key findings: MiniVess dataset
            paper (Poon 2023) was missing from bibliography; MedMLOps
            (European Radiology) closest published comparator; CheXstray/MMC+
            validates multi-modal drift detection; Kapoor 2022 data leakage
            as #1 reproducibility threat; DataLad superior provenance but
            DVC better ML pipeline fit.
            70 nodes, 131 explicit edges (+conditional_on in decision files).
    v2.0.0: Phase 20 — Regulatory operations. Added 2 new nodes
            (regulatory_compliance_approach, audit_trail_architecture)
            and 5 new edges. Updated 4 existing nodes (compliance_depth,
            documentation_generation, model_governance, drift_response).
            15 new bibliography entries. Key findings: LLMs achieve
            kappa=0.863 on EU AI Act compliance (AIReg-Bench, Marino 2025),
            OLIF audit-trail fabrication in LLM agents (de la Torre 2026),
            10-step certification pipeline from aerospace (Lacasa 2025),
            ComplOps shift-left compliance-as-code (Batista 2025),
            three-layer audit trail architecture (Ojewale 2026).
            70 nodes, 130 explicit edges (+conditional_on in decision files).
    v1.9.0: Phase 19 — MLOps practices. Updated 5 existing nodes
            (monitoring_stack, drift_detection_method, drift_response,
            model_governance, serving_architecture) and added 4 new edges.
            15 new bibliography entries. Key findings: 77% monitoring gap
            (Leest 2025a), Causal System Maps for drift attribution (Leest
            2025b), 17-practice monitoring checklist (Protschky 2025),
            SecMLOps PTPGC framework (Zhang 2026), hexagonal architecture
            for segmentation microservices (Cordeiro 2025), ML Canvas
            strategy > tooling (Prause 2026).
            68 nodes, 125 explicit edges (+conditional_on in decision files).
    v1.8.0: Phase 18 — data science practices with agents. Updated 3 existing
            nodes (agent_framework, copilot_backend, uncertainty_quantification)
            and added 3 new edges. 12 new bibliography entries. Key framework:
            L0-L5 data agent autonomy taxonomy (Luo et al., 2026; Zhu et al., 2025)
            maps minivess at L2 (tool-assisted), target L3 (autonomous orchestration).
            TissueLab co-evolving agent pattern, MedBayes-Lite Bayesian UQ, and
            Medical Graph RAG for protocol knowledge provide actionable angles.
            68 nodes, 121 explicit edges (+conditional_on in decision files).
    v1.7.0: Phase 17 — data engineering quality/ETL/interoperability. Added 3
            nodes (data_harmonization_method, clinical_data_format,
            data_storage_architecture) and 8 explicit edges. 15 new bibliography
            entries. Novel finding: no dedicated vascular MRI harmonization
            methods exist (gap in arXiv:2507.16962v2 survey). FHIR-to-KG
            vertical stack (Marfoglia group) provides clinical data backbone.
            68 nodes, 118 explicit edges (+conditional_on in decision files).
    v1.6.0: Phase 16 — agentic RAG/IaC angle plan integration. Added 4 nodes
            (acquisition_agent, telemetry_backend, clinical_contract_schema,
            copilot_backend) and 10 explicit edges. 15 new bibliography entries.
            Novel synthesis: conformal prediction × smart microscopy × vascular
            MLOps. 65 nodes, 110 explicit edges (+conditional_on in decision files).
    v1.5.0: Phase 15 — interactive segmentation research integration. Updated
            annotation_platform (added slicer_nninteractive, napari_nninteractive
            options; nnInteractive CVPR 2025 1st place) and annotation_workflow
            (added slicer_proofread option; proofreading paradigm validated).
            12 new bibliography entries. 61 nodes, 118 edges.
    v1.4.0: Phase 14 — integrated monitoring research. Added 2 nodes
            (drift_detection_method, model_promotion_strategy) and 7 edges.
            Deprecated EDL in uncertainty_quantification. 61 nodes, 118 edges.
    v1.3.0: Phase 11 — added 3 clinical SaMD nodes (project_management_tool,
            regulatory_documentation_tool, clinical_deployment_platform) and
            14 edges. 59 nodes, 111 edges.
    v1.2.0: Phase 10 — added 4 stack coverage nodes (language_runtime,
            package_manager, linter_formatter, type_checker) and 12 edges.
            56 nodes, 97 edges.
    v1.1.0: Fixed cycle (removed model_export_format→serving_architecture),
            removed duplicate edge, added 5 missing edges. 52 nodes, 85 edges.
    v1.0.0: Initial network — 52 nodes, ~80 edges.
