description: >
  Continuous integration and deployment platform. GitHub Actions is the
  default for GitHub-hosted projects; GitLab CI offers self-hosted
  alternative; Buildkite provides hybrid cloud/self-hosted; Jenkins is
  legacy but ubiquitous in enterprises.

    title: "GitHub Actions"
    description: >
      GitHub-native CI/CD with marketplace actions. Currently used for
      linting, testing, and CML integration. Free tier for public repos,
      generous minutes for private. Excellent ecosystem.

    title: "GitLab CI"
    description: >
      GitLab-native CI/CD with .gitlab-ci.yml. Self-hosted runners
      available. Common in academic institutions with GitLab instances.
      Good Docker and K8s integration.

    constraints:
      - "Requires GitLab migration or mirror"
      - "Different YAML syntax from GitHub Actions"

  - option_id: buildkite
    title: "Buildkite"
    description: >
      Hybrid CI/CD with self-hosted agents. Excellent for GPU workloads
      with custom agent infrastructure. Pay per usage.
    prior_probability: 0.15
    status: viable
    implementation_status: not_started
    constraints:
      - "Self-hosted agent management"

    description: >
      Self-hosted, highly customizable CI/CD. Ubiquitous in enterprise
      and legacy environments. Plugin ecosystem but maintenance heavy.
    prior_probability: 0.15

    constraints:
      - "Server maintenance overhead"

rationale: >
  GitHub Actions (0.50) is resolved. The project is GitHub-hosted with
  existing workflows for linting, testing, and CML. GitLab CI (0.20)
  would be relevant if the project moved to an institutional GitLab.
