# Original Prompt (Verbatim)

> Could we do a second-pass analysis to /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/minivess-mlops/docs/planning/agentic-architecture-self-reflection-for-sdd-and-beyond-paper-as-agentic.md and think how our architecture choices should change if we change actually the main novelty contribution of this academic paper to be sent to Nature Methods or to some lower impact journal method like Journal of Neuroscience Methods. We should aim to be the first or one of the first papers that show how you can create these types of research infrastructure MLOps totally using agentic tools like Claude Code now (and align with the slides in /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/sci-llm-writer/manuscripts/vibe-coding-slides), and treat the process as much as the novelty as the system created with this "agentic" process. And for instance our probabilistic PRD if translated to SDD approach could be such an abstraction if provided in the repo with the paper would allow researchers to create their own systems using this spec with slight modifications to it if your implementation does not help them? The old way of doing things would be that we provide the repo and they can modify it and even refactor from scratch but this is ridiculously laborious process and often not feasible at all. Whereas now with SDD and Claude Code you could do this from scratch? Save my prompt verbatim first, and let's start writing and optimizing it with reviewer agents for factual correctness and non-ambiguous execution with TDD agents being more ambitious than initially thought
