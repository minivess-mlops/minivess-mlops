title: "Loss Functions"
description: >
  Which loss functions to support for segmentation training. The choice
  interacts strongly with model architecture and target anatomy. Vascular
  segmentation specifically benefits from topology-preserving losses like
  clDice that penalize broken connectivity in thin tubular structures.
  The dynunet_loss_variation_v2 experiment (2026-02-27) resolved the default
  to cbdice_cldice based on best topology-accuracy tradeoff across 4 losses
  x 3 folds x 100 epochs. See docs/results/dynunet_loss_variation_v2_report.md.

      Best topology-accuracy tradeoff from dynunet_loss_variation_v2:
      0.906 clDice, 0.772 DSC, 1.74 MASD. Combines diameter-aware
      boundary supervision (cbDice, Shi et al. 2024) with skeleton-preserving
      topology (clDice, Shit et al. 2021). Default for single-model training.

      Standard compound loss combining Dice overlap with voxel-wise

      (0.824) and MASD (1.68) but weaker topology preservation (0.832 clDice).
      Use for non-vascular segmentation or as ablation baseline.

      Not recommended standalone (empty prediction collapse risk).

rationale: >
  cbdice_cldice (0.40) is the new default based on dynunet_loss_variation_v2
  experiment (2026-02-27, 4 losses x 3 folds x 100 epochs). It achieved the
  best topology-accuracy tradeoff: 0.906 clDice with only -5.3% DSC penalty
  vs dice_ce baseline. dice_ce (0.25) remains the robust baseline for
  non-vascular or overlap-focused tasks. Pure Dice (0.20) and Focal (0.15)
  provide alternatives for class-imbalance scenarios. Standalone clDice (0.10)
  is implemented but not recommended alone due to empty-prediction collapse risk.
  TopK (0.10) is a niche option for extreme imbalance.
