  How regulatory compliance is managed operationally. ComplOps-style automated
  compliance embeds Compliance-as-Code (CaC) into CI/CD pipelines (Batista et al.,
  2025). Manual audit relies on periodic human review with spreadsheet/document
  tracking. Hybrid LLM-assisted uses frontier LLMs for compliance assessment
  (AIReg-Bench validated: kappa up to 0.863; Marino et al., 2025) with human
  oversight. The CAIRC Inspector/Mechanic closed-loop pattern (Marino & Lane,
  2026) provides a framework for continuous automated compliance. Compliance
  costs estimated at EUR 7,500-400,000 per system motivate automation.

      Frontier LLMs screen technical documentation against regulatory
      requirements (EU AI Act Articles 9, 10, 12, 14, 15), with human
      expert review of flagged issues. AIReg-Bench (Marino et al., 2025)
      validates that Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves kappa = 0.863 on EU AI Act
      compliance assessment. TechOps templates (Lucaj et al., 2025) provide
      structured input format. Delta-I integrity metric (de la Torre, 2026)
      with medical threshold 0.30 guards against LLM audit trail fabrication.

rationale: >
  Manual audit (0.40) is the current resolved state reflecting lightweight
  compliance implementation. Hybrid LLM-assisted (0.35) is the strongest
  emerging option, validated by AIReg-Bench (Marino et al., 2025) showing
  frontier LLMs achieve kappa up to 0.863 on EU AI Act compliance. ComplOps
  automated (0.25) requires more infrastructure investment but provides the
  most robust continuous compliance. The convergence of EU AI Act (Aug 2026),
  IEC 62304 Ed.2 (Sep 2026), and FDA QMSR (Feb 2026) creates urgency for
  moving beyond manual compliance. Compliance costs of EUR 7,500-400,000
  per system (Haataja & Bryson, 2021; Koh et al., 2024, as cited in Marino
  et al.) make automation economically compelling.
