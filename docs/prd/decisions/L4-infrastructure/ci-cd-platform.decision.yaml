title: "CI/CD Platform"
description: >
  Continuous integration and deployment platform. GitHub Actions is the
  default for GitHub-hosted projects; GitLab CI offers self-hosted
  alternative; Buildkite provides hybrid cloud/self-hosted; Jenkins is
  legacy but ubiquitous in enterprises. For SaMD compliance, the CI/CD
  platform requires tool validation per ISO 13485 Clause 4.1.6 — every
  tool used in the QMS (Git, CI runners, test frameworks, deployment
  tools) needs risk-based validation with documented results. IEC 62304
  Clause 8 (configuration management) mandates traceable control over
  all software artifacts through the CI/CD pipeline.

    title: "GitHub Actions"
    description: >
      GitHub-native CI/CD with marketplace actions. Currently used for
      linting, testing, and CML integration. Free tier for public repos,
      generous minutes for private. Excellent ecosystem. SOC 1/SOC 2
      Type 2 certified. Enterprise audit log streaming. For IEC 62304:
      commit signing provides authorship verification (Clause 8),
      branch protection enforces code review, Ketryx integrates for
      automated compliance evidence generation.

rationale: >
  GitHub Actions (0.50) is resolved, following continuous delivery for ML
  patterns (Sato et al., 2019) and MLOps architecture principles
  (Kreuzberger et al., 2023). The project is GitHub-hosted with existing
  workflows for linting, testing, and CML (Ruf et al., 2021). GitLab CI (0.20)
  would be relevant if the project moved to an institutional GitLab.
