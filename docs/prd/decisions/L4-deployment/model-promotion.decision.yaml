title: "Model Promotion Strategy"
description: >
  Strategy for promoting models through deployment stages
  (DEVELOPMENT -> STAGING -> PRODUCTION). Automated promotion with
  quality gates ensures metrics thresholds are met. Manual promotion
  provides human oversight. Shadow deployment allows risk-free testing.

    description: >
      Automatic promotion through PromotionCriteria checks (min DSC,
      min clDice thresholds). Creates audit trail for each promotion
      decision. Implemented via ModelRegistry.promote() with criteria.

    title: "Manual Review"
    description: >
      Human-in-the-loop promotion requiring explicit approval before
      each stage transition. Provides maximum oversight but slower
      deployment velocity.

    title: "Shadow Deployment"
    description: >
      Deploy new model alongside production for comparison without
