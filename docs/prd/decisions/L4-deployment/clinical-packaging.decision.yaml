description: >
  Packaging format for clinical and regulatory environments. MONAI Deploy
  MAP provides standardized Docker-based packaging with metadata for
  medical device compliance. Custom packaging offers flexibility but
  lacks standardized tooling.

    description: >
      MONAI Application Package format with standardized manifest,
      operator pipeline, and Docker packaging. Integrates with MONAI
      ecosystem and clinical workflow engines. Implemented as optional
      feature via monai_deploy_enabled flag.
