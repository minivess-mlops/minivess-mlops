description: >
  Domain overlay for brain tumor and stroke lesion segmentation.
  Targets BraTS (brain tumor) and ISLES (ischemic stroke) datasets.
  Multi-modal MRI with complex heterogeneous lesions.

dataset:
  name: "BraTS / ISLES"
  modality: "Multi-modal MRI (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR)"
  structures:
    - name: "Enhancing tumor (ET)"
      label_id: 1
      difficulty: "High"
    - name: "Tumor core (TC)"
      label_id: 2
      difficulty: "Medium"
    - name: "Whole tumor (WT)"
      label_id: 3
      difficulty: "Medium"
    - name: "Stroke lesion"
      label_id: 1
      difficulty: "High — heterogeneous"
  challenges:
    - "Multi-modal input fusion"
    - "Hierarchical tumor sub-regions"
    - "Heterogeneous lesion appearance"
    - "Small enhancing regions"

metric_adjustments:
  adjustments:
    - metric: surface_dice
      weight_boost: 0.10
      rationale: "Surface Dice important for tumor boundary delineation"
    - metric: lesion_wise_f1
      weight_boost: 0.05
      rationale: "Lesion-level detection for clinical relevance"

loss_adjustments:
  adjustments:
    - loss: deep_supervision
      viability_boost: 0.10
      rationale: "Multi-scale supervision for hierarchical structures"
    - loss: region_based
      viability_boost: 0.05
      rationale: "Region-specific loss for WT/TC/ET hierarchy"

prd_prior_adjustments:
  adjustments:
    - decision_id: segmentation_models
      option_id: swinunetr
      adjustment: "+0.10"
      rationale: "SwinUNETR was designed for and excels at BraTS"
    - decision_id: augmentation_stack
      option_id: monai_basic
      adjustment: "+0.05"
      rationale: "MONAI transforms include BraTS-specific augmentations"

vocabulary:
  primary_structure: "brain tumors / stroke lesions"
  imaging_modality: "multi-modal MRI"
  key_metric: "Surface Dice"
  primary_challenge: "multi-modal fusion and hierarchical segmentation"
