rationale: >
  CHANGE_ME: Justify prior probabilities with academic citations.
  Example: "Option A receives 0.50 prior based on benchmark results
  from Surname et al. (2024), who report X metric on Y dataset (Table N).
  Option B at 0.50 follows Othername & Coauthor (2023) showing competitive
  performance in Z setting."

# ACADEMIC REFERENCES — MANDATORY
# Every citation_key MUST exist in bibliography.yaml.
# References are append-only: NEVER remove existing references.
