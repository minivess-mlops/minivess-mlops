# Network Template: Bayesian Decision Network DAG
# Copy this file to your SDD's decisions/_network.yaml and populate with your nodes.
#
# The network defines the DAG topology: which decisions exist and how they
# influence each other. Decision content lives in individual .decision.yaml files.

  name: "CHANGE_ME Project — Probabilistic SDD Decision Network"
  version: "1.0.0"
  last_updated: "CHANGE_ME"
  description: >
    Bayesian decision network for CHANGE_ME project.
    Captures open-ended technology and architecture decisions as a
    probabilistic DAG with conditional dependencies and archetype modulations.

  # Decision hierarchy levels — add nodes under each level
  levels:
    - level_id: L1
      title: "Research Goals"
      description: >
        Strategic project direction. Why does this project exist?
        What impact does it target? What constraints are non-negotiable?

    - level_id: L2
      title: "Architecture"
      description: >
        Architectural patterns and high-level approaches. How will the
        system be structured? What design patterns apply?

    - level_id: L3
      title: "Technology"
      description: >
        Specific tools, libraries, and frameworks. Which concrete
        implementations fulfill the architectural decisions?

    - level_id: L4
      title: "Infrastructure"
      description: >
        Compute, containers, CI/CD, deployment targets. Where and how
        does the system run?

    - level_id: L5
      title: "Operations"
      description: >
        Monitoring, governance, retraining, maintenance workflows.
        How is the system kept healthy in production?
