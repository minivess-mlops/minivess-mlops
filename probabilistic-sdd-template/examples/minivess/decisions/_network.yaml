# MinIVess MLOps v2 — Example SDD Network (curated subset)
# This is a subset of the full 70-node network to demonstrate the SDD structure.

network:
  name: "MinIVess MLOps v2 (Example Subset)"
  version: "1.0.0"
  last_updated: "2026-03-01"
  description: >
    Curated subset of the MinIVess probabilistic SDD showing one L1
    and one L3 decision with a conditional dependency.

  nodes:
    - id: project_purpose
      level: L1
      file: "L1-research-goals/project-purpose.decision.yaml"
      title: "Project Purpose"

    - id: loss_functions
      level: L3
      file: "L3-technology/loss-functions.decision.yaml"
      title: "Loss Functions"

  edges:
    - from: project_purpose
      to: loss_functions
      influence: weak
      rationale: "Project purpose (learning vs clinical) influences loss complexity tolerance"
