# Build 2 different Docker Images :
# * the "Environment" now refers to the image containing all the needed Ubuntu packages and Python libraries,
#   and what you could use as an interpreter in PyCharm, and what you would like to auto-build only when
#   Poetry environment or the Dockerfile changes
# * TODO! "Execution Docker" that would be based on the "Environment" that contains the executable code, and is
#   auto-built everytime the `src` and ` model` code has updates
