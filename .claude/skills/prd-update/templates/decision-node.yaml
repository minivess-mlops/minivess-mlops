# ACADEMIC CITATION REQUIREMENTS:
# - Every decision MUST have at least 1 reference in the references array
# - Every citation_key MUST exist in docs/planning/prd/bibliography.yaml
# - The rationale field MUST include author-year in-text citations
# - Use "Surname et al. (Year)" format, never numeric references

  CHANGE_ME: Justify prior probabilities with academic citations.
  Example: "Option A receives 0.50 prior based on benchmark results
  from Surname et al. (2024), who report X metric on Y dataset (Table N).
  Option B at 0.50 follows Othername & Coauthor (2023) showing competitive
  performance in Z setting."
